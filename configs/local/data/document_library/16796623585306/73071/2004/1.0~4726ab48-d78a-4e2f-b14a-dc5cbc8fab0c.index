Standard Reading Glasses Instruction Manual 

Congratulations on your new Reading Glasses! 

These glasses are designed to help you see clearly at close distances, making reading, crafting, 
and other detailed tasks easier. Please read these instructions carefully to ensure proper use 
and care. 

1. Putting on Your Glasses: 

● Hold the glasses by the temples (the arms that go over your ears). 
● Gently position the front of the glasses on the bridge of your nose. 
● Slide the temples over your ears. The glasses should feel comfortable and secure. 

2. Using Your Reading Glasses: 

● These glasses are specifically designed for near vision. They may blur your vision when 
looking at distant objects. 

● Adjust the position of the glasses slightly on your nose to find the clearest focus for your 
reading material. 

3. Caring for Your Reading Glasses: 

● Cleaning: To clean the lenses, use the provided microfiber cloth. Gently wipe away any 
smudges or dust. If necessary, you can use a mild dish soap and water, rinsing 
thoroughly and then drying with the microfiber cloth. Avoid using paper towels or harsh 
chemicals, as these can scratch the lenses. 

● Storage: When not in use, store your glasses in the provided case to protect them from 
scratches and damage. Avoid placing them lens-down on any surface. 

● Handling: Handle your glasses with care. Avoid bending or twisting the frames. 

4. Important Notes: 

● These reading glasses are not intended for driving or operating heavy machinery. 
● If you experience any discomfort or vision problems, consult an eye care professional. 

Thank you for choosing our reading glasses! We hope they enhance your near-vision tasks.
