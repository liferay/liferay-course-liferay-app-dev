Protect Your Eyes with Your New Blue Light Blocking Glasses! 

These glasses are designed to filter out a portion of the blue light emitted from digital screens, 
potentially reducing eye strain and improving sleep quality. Please read the following 
instructions for optimal use. 

1. Putting on Your Glasses: 

● Hold the glasses by the temples. 
● Rest the bridge of the glasses comfortably on your nose. 
● Slide the temples over your ears. The glasses should fit comfortably for extended wear. 

2. Using Your Blue Light Blocking Glasses: 

● Wear these glasses when using digital devices such as computers, smartphones, 
tablets, and televisions. 

● You may notice a slight yellow tint in the lenses, which is part of the blue light filtering 
technology. This tint should not significantly alter your color perception. 

3. Caring for Your Glasses: 

● Cleaning: Use the provided microfiber cloth to gently clean the lenses. If needed, you 
can use a lens cleaning spray. Avoid abrasive materials that could scratch the lenses. 

● Storage: Store your glasses in their case when you are not wearing them to keep them 
protected from dust and scratches. 

4. Important Notes: 

● These glasses are primarily designed for indoor use with digital screens. 
● While blue light blocking glasses may help reduce eye strain, they are not a substitute 

for proper ergonomics and taking breaks from screen time. 
● If you experience persistent eye discomfort, consult an eye care professional. 

Thank you for choosing our blue light blocking glasses! We hope they provide you with greater 
comfort while using your digital devices.
