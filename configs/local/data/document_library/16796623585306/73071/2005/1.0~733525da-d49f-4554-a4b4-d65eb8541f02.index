Sports Sunglasses Instruction Manual 

Welcome to Enhanced Vision with Your New Sports Sunglasses! 

These sunglasses are engineered to provide superior protection and clarity for your active 
lifestyle. Please read these instructions to maximize their performance and longevity. 

1. Wearing Your Sunglasses: 

● Hold the sunglasses by the temples. 
● Position the frame comfortably on the bridge of your nose. 
● Slide the temples over your ears. The sunglasses should feel secure during movement. 

Some models may have additional features like adjustable nose pads or temple tips for a 
customized fit. Adjust these as needed for optimal comfort and stability. 

2. Lens Technology: 

● Your sports sunglasses feature lenses designed to reduce glare and provide UV 
protection. The specific lens tint may enhance contrast for certain activities. 

● Avoid touching the lenses directly to prevent fingerprints and smudges. 

3. Care and Maintenance: 

● Cleaning: Rinse the lenses with water to remove any dirt or debris. Then, gently clean 
them with the provided microfiber cloth. For stubborn smudges, you can use a lens 
cleaning solution. 

● Storage: When not in use, store your sunglasses in the provided protective case. This 
will prevent scratches and damage. 

● Handling: Be mindful of your sunglasses during activities. Avoid dropping them or 
exposing them to extreme temperatures. 

4. Important Information: 

● While these sunglasses offer impact resistance, they are not unbreakable and do not 
provide complete protection against all types of impact. 

● Regularly inspect your sunglasses for any signs of damage. If you notice any cracks or 
loose parts, discontinue use and consider replacement. 

Enjoy your activities with enhanced vision and protection!
